# TCPIP-Volume1-Practice 
This project aims to demomstrate the network knowledge illustrated in the classic book [TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The protocols](https://www.amazon.com/TCP-Illustrated-Protocols-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321336313/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1541126644&sr=8-1&keywords=tcp%2Fip+illustrated+volume+1). Unlike other network tutorial, either only focusing on the theory description, or practical usage, we illustrate them both, theory and practice, in order to make readers fully understand network through [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method), and construct your own [knowledge pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid) of network. The presentation formats in this project includes article, code, and video, which are hosted on `github`, `youtube` and `patreon`.

The project is divided into following sections:
* LAN network of sole device
* LAN network with two devices
* LAN network with three and more devices
* Network services under Client-Server model
* Router and LAN
* WAN
