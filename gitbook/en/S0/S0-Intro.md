# Overview 

[TODO: Add graph of TCP/IP and OSI model]

As seen above, the classic pciture to define each layer in TCP/IP and OSI model, as well as the mapping between those two models.
In this tutorial, we are going to explain following concepts and mechanism with experiment with refer to the TCP/IP model,
* What are TCP/IP and OSI model ?
* Why does layer exist ?
* What are those layers and their functionalities ?
* What are those protocols running on each layer ? How do they work ?
* How does the data look like in each layer ?

In order to answer the questions above, the topologies of experiments are designed inductively, 
[TODO: Add topology]
* LAN with only one device
* LAN with two devices
* LAN with multiple devices
* Connect two LANs with router
* Connect multiple LANs
* Connect LAN with WAN
