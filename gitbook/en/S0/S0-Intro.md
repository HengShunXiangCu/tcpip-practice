As seen above, the classic graph to define each layer in TCP/IP and OSI model, as well as the mapping between those two models.
In this tutorial, we are going to explain following concepts and mechanisms with experiments with refer to the TCP/IP model,
* What are TCP/IP and OSI model ?
* Why does layer exist ?
* What are those layers and their functionalities ?
* What are those protocols running on each layer ? How do they work ?
* How does the data look like in each layer ?

In order to answer the questions above, the topologies of experiments are designed inductively,
