# One-to-Two

After finishing this tutorial, you will understand following questions:

* How to explore the network status on your PC ?
* How to create a network within only two computers, and what the communication looks like ?

More important, you will obtain the knowledge as following,

* The usage of network utilities in Linux
* The usage of wireshark
* The TCP/IP and OSI model


We are not going to lecture you like any other network books do, but start the hands-on experiments to walk you through the concepts of network, and inspire you to think independently, even design your own network experiments.
