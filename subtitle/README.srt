Hi, guys. Now I am making a serie of videos around network introduction. When I learnt network by myself, I've started with the book of `TCP/IP Illustratd Volume 1`, which is a very classic book. And at that time, I just read the book, and somehow think OK, I understand what it is written, however, I couldn't test the statements in the book, for which, I have to design experiments, test result, and repeat this process. But back that time, I was in high school, and cannot afford multiple computers to do so. And now, I have enough resources, and I would like to finish what I have left and share this experience with others. And I hope it is going to be helpful for those who want to learn network.
